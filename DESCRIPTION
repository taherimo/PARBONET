Title: Simulation of Parameterized Stochastic Boolean Networks
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Applying stochastic noise to Boolean networks is a useful approach for representing the effects of various perturbing stimuli on complex systems. A number of methods have been developed to control the noise effect on Boolean networks using a set of parameters integrated into the update rules. This package provides functions to examine three of these methods: BNp, described by Trairatphisan et al. (2013) <doi:10.1186/1478-811X-11-46>, SDDS, proposed by Murrugarra et al. (2012) <doi:10.1186/1687-4153-2012-5>, and PEW, presented by Deritei et al. (2022) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010536>. This package includes source code derived from the 'BoolNet' package, which is licensed under the Artistic License 2.0.
